# Analysis of Timely and Effective Hospital Care Data

This notebook analyzes data from the file `/content/Timely_and_Effective_Care-Hospital.csv` to understand key aspects of timely and effective hospital care.

## Data Source Acknowledgement

The data used in this analysis is from the file `/content/Timely_and_Effective_Care-Hospital.csv`, which contains information about timely and effective care measures for hospitals.

## Data Loading

The data was loaded from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

## Data Exploration

Initial data exploration was performed to understand the structure, data types, and identify missing values.

- Displayed the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.
- Checked column names and their data types.
- Checked for missing values in each column.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

The analysis focused on understanding the distribution of scores and exploring the relationship between scores and different measures and states.

- Examined the 'Score' column, handling "Not Available" values by converting them to numerical (with `NaN` for non-numeric).
- Visualized the distribution of numerical scores using a histogram.
- Analyzed the 'Measure Name' column to identify unique and frequent measures.
- Selected the top 5 most frequent measures for further visualization.
- Created box plots to compare the distribution of scores for the selected measures.
- Explored the relationship between 'Score' and 'State' for the 'Left before being seen' measure using box plots for states with sufficient data.

## Summary of Findings

Based on the analysis, key findings include:

- The distribution of timely and effective care scores varies across different measures and facilities.
- The 'Score' column contains non-numeric values that need to be considered during analysis.
- There is considerable variability in scores among different timely and effective care measures.
- The 'Left before being seen' measure shows variations in performance across different states.

Further analysis could involve investigating factors contributing to variations in scores and exploring correlations between hospital characteristics and performance.

## Requirements

The following libraries were used in this analysis:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file generated in this notebook.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Upload the `/content/Timely_and_Effective_Care-Hospital.csv` file to your Colab environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
